# Python Practice Paper

This repository contains a collection of Python programs for practice and learning. Each file addresses a specific programming problem, ranging from basic input/output and arithmetic operations to more advanced topics like number theory, series, and string manipulation.

## Folder Structure

- Each file is named according to the question or problem it solves (e.g., `p1_q1.py`, `p2_q15.py`).
- Problems cover a wide variety of topics, including:
  - Basic arithmetic and logic
  - Loops and conditionals
  - String and list operations
  - Number theory (prime, perfect, composite numbers, etc.)
  - Series and sequences
  - Conversion between number systems

## How to Use
